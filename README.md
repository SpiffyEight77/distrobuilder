## Installing from package

## Installing from source

To compile `distrobuilder` from source, first install the Go programming language, and some other dependencies.

- Debian-based:
    ```
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install -y golang-go debootstrap rsync gpg squashfs-tools git make build-essential
    ```

- ArchLinux-based:
    ```
    sudo pacman -Syu
    sudo pacman -S go debootstrap rsync gnupg squashfs-tools git make --needed
    ```

- Red Hat-based:
    ```
	sudo dnf check-update
    sudo dnf install golang debootstrap rsync gnupg2 squashfs-tools git make
    ```

NOTE: Distrobuilder requires Go 1.21 or higher, if your distribution doesn't have a recent enough version available, [get it from upstream](https://go.dev/doc/install).

Second, download the source code of the `distrobuilder` repository (this repository).

```
mkdir -p $HOME/go/src/github.com/lxc/
cd $HOME/go/src/github.com/lxc/
git clone https://github.com/lxc/distrobuilder
```

Third, enter the directory with the source code of `distrobuilder` and run `make` to compile the source code. This will generate the executable program `distrobuilder`, and it will be located at `$HOME/go/bin/distrobuilder`.

```
cd ./distrobuilder
make
```

Finally, you can run `distrobuilder` as follows.
```
$HOME/go/bin/distrobuilder
```

You may also add the directory `$HOME/go/bin/` to your $PATH so that you do not need to run the command with the full path.
